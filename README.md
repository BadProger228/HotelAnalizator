# HotelAnalyzer

## Description
**HotelAnalyzer** is a neural network-based application that helps users determine how suitable a hotel might be for them, based on their past hotel ratings. Users provide data about hotels they have previously rated, and the model learns their preferences. Then, by inputting features like price and average community rating for a new hotel, the application predicts how well it is likely to match the user's tastes.

## Features
- Train a neural network model on user-rated hotel data.
- Input price and community rating to get a suitability score for a hotel.
- Friendly graphical interface built with Tkinter.
- Data persistence using a custom hotel database module.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Machine Learning Framework:** Scikit-learn
